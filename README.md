I built this after reading The Missing Billionaires. Thesis of the book is that fortunes are lost through poor portfolio management. If the descendents of billionaires managed their money properly, they would dominate the rich lists to this day.

The author of the book built an identical game on the Elm Wealth website but it had a user experience I did not enjoy. I wanted to play around with the game so I built it with a few features fixed.

The game demonstrates that even in a trading scenario with a statistical edge, you can still lose all of your money if you adopt improper position sizing and poor risk management. 

The game is placing bets on a coin flip where the coin lands on heads 60% of the time. See if you can play around and find an optimal strategy and make lots of $$.
