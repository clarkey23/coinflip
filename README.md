I built this after reading [*The Missing Billionaires*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Missing_Billionaires). The thesis of the book is that fortunes are lost through poor portfolio management — if the descendants of billionaires had managed their money properly, they would dominate the rich lists to this day.

The author built an identical game on the Elm Wealth website, but the UX didn’t work for me. I wanted to explore the game properly, so I rebuilt it with a few fixes.

The game shows that even with a statistical edge, you can still lose everything if you use bad position sizing and risk management. You bet on coin flips where the coin lands on heads 60% of the time. See if you can find a strategy that grows your stack.
